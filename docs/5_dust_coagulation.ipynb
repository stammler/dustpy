    "## Sticking\n",
    "\n",
    "Sticking means that two particles collide and form a new larger particles conserving the total mass. There are two complications when implementing this numerically:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, since we need to cover a high dynamic range from particles masses around $10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{g}$ to more than $10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{g}$ while still having a reasonable number of mass bins, the mass grid has to be logarithmic. This has the disadvantage that the new particle mass resulting from a collision will not directly lie on the mass grid, but will fall in between two grid masses. The resulting mass has to be therefore distributed between the two adjacent grid cells. This means there will be density added to a mass bin that is larger than the actual mass of the resulting particle. This can have unwanted side effects if the mass grid is too coarse. Please see [Drążkowska et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201423708) and the notebook with the analytical coagulation kernels for details on the minimum mass resulution that should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if the masses of the two colliding particles differ by more than $15$ orders of magnitude (double-precision floating-point format) the resulting mass is (for a computer) identical to the mass of the larger particle. "
