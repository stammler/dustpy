``DustPy`` Documentation
=========================================

| ``DustPy`` is a Python package to simulate the evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks.

| This documentation is for ``DustPy v1.0.2``.

| ``DustPy`` simulates the radial evolution of gas and dust in protoplanetary disks, including viscous evolution of the gas, advection and diffusion of the dust, as well as dust growth by solving the Smoluchowski equation.

| ``DustPy`` can be installed via the Python Package Index
| ``pip install dustpy``

| ``DustPy`` requires a Python3 distribution and a Fortran compiler.

| ``DustPy`` is based on the ``Simframe`` framework for scientific simulation (`Stammler & Birnstiel 2022 <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03882>`_).
| Please have a look at the `Simframe Documentation <https://simframe.rtfd.io>`_ for details of its usage.
