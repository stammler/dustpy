    "#### Change in default temperature profile\n",
    "\n",
    "A factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ was added to the luminosisty in the standard update function of the gas temperature `Simulation.gas.T`, when calculating the midplane equilibrium temperature in accordance with e.g. [Chiang & Goldreich (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1086/304869) or [Dullemond et al. (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1086/323057):\n",

    "$T\\left( r \\right) = \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{0.05\\,L_*}{4\\,\\pi\\,r^2\\,\\sigma_\\mathrm{SB}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to previous versions the midplane temperature is therefore reduced by a factor of $\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{2}}\\approx0.84$. However, we want to point out that both approximations are _\"equally bad\"_ compared to radiative transfer calculations with e.g. RADMC3D."

    "#### Change to Collision Kernel\n",

    "A factor was added to the standard update function of `Simulation.dust.kernel`, that reduces the collision rates of equal size collisions by a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$K_{ij} = \\frac{1}{1+\\delta_{ij}} \\frac{\\pi\\left( a_i + a_j \\right)^2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\left( H_i^2 + H_j^2 \\right)}} v_\\mathrm{rel}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions between particles of two separate reservoirs $i$ and $j$ occur at a rate $\\propto N_i N_j$, since every particle in one reservoir can collide with every particle in the other reservoir. Collisions of particles in the same reservoir occur at reduces rates: the first particle can collide with $N_i-1$ other particles, the second particle with $N_i-2$ particles, and so on, to avoid double counting of collisions. In that case the collision rates are $\\propto \\frac{1}{2}N_i\\left(N_i-1\\right)$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}N_i^2$ in the limit of large $N_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This change has no noticable effect on simulations performed with previous versions, since it is only reducing the collision rate for a single type of collisions."
