'''``DustPy`` is a package for simulating dust coagulation and disk evolution in protoplanetary disks.

The class for performing simulations is ``dustpy.Simulation``.

Furthermore ``DustPy`` contains a simple package for plotting data ``dustpy.plot`` and a package
that contains pre-defined standard functions ``dustpy.std`` that can be used in the simulation.

``dustpy.utils`` contains some helper classes/functions that are used within the simulation.

``DustPy`` is mainly written in ``Python``. Computation intensive calculations are written in ``Fortran``.

``DustPy`` is using the ``simframe`` package for setting up scientific simulations.'''
